# 🌐 S3 Static Website Hosting Demo

Welcome to a quick and practical AWS demo from **DevOpsEasy Learning Training Institute**!

This guide will show you how to host a static website using **Amazon S3**, without using EC2 or a web server. Just upload an HTML file, enable website hosting, and your site goes live — cloud-native and serverless!

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Host a `index.html` file as a static website using Amazon S3
- Access the website via a public S3 endpoint
- Understand how S3 static hosting works in real-world scenarios

---

## 🧰 Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- IAM user with S3 permissions
- A simple `index.html` file (included in this repo)

---

## 🚀 Steps to Deploy Your Static Website on S3

### 🔹 1. Create an S3 Bucket

1. Go to [S3 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/)
2. Click **Create bucket**
3. Name your bucket (e.g., `my-static-site-devops2025`)
4. Uncheck **Block all public access**
5. Acknowledge the warning ✅
6. Click **Create bucket**

---

### 🔹 2. Upload `index.html`

1. Click on the bucket you just created
2. Click **Upload**
3. Upload your `index.html` file
4. Click **Upload**

---

### 🔹 3. Enable Static Website Hosting

1. Go to the **Properties** tab of the bucket
2. Scroll to **Static website hosting**
3. Click **Edit**
4. Choose **Enable**
5. Set the **Index document** as `index.html`
6. Save changes

You’ll get a **Website endpoint URL** — copy it!

---

### 🔹 4. Make Objects Public (Set Bucket Policy)

Go to the **Permissions** tab → **Bucket Policy** → Add this policy:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [{
    "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": "*",
    "Action": "s3:GetObject",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_BUCKET_NAME/*"
  }]
}

✅ Replace YOUR_BUCKET_NAME with your actual bucket name.

🔹 5. View Your Website!
Visit the website endpoint URL provided by S3 — it should display your HTML page!
